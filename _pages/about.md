Hi, My name is Nyukshan and I am currently living in Germany. I came here 10 years ago, and completed my Bachelors and Masters Degree in Geosciences. I am currently working in a civil, environmental enngineering industry. My recent work involved conducting environemental due diligence for construction projects and writing up reports to facilate better decision making for the clients. I would like to advance my carrer into a more management role and am considering an MBA.  In my free time, I like to read travel around and do photography.
